SUMMARY = "A small daemon managing kernel hotplug events, similarly to udevd."
DESCRIPTION = "It uses the same configuration file as mdev, which is a hotplug manager integrated in the Busybox suite of tools. However, mdev needs to be registered in /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug, and the kernel forks an instance of mdev for every event; by contrast, mdevd is a daemon and does not fork."
